        The web client
      </mat-panel-title>
    </mat-expansion-panel-header>
    <p>
      The client is created using the latest version of Angular.
    </p>
    <p>
    The application uses Angular Material combined with Bootstrap 4 for it's styling.
    Some custom modifications has been made also. For icons I've used Font Awesome.
    </p>

    <p>
      The charts in the app is created with <a href="https://www.chartjs.org" target="_blank">Charts.js</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The client is hosted in an AWS S3 bucket.

        Server side

    </mat-expansion-panel-header>
    <p>
      The current backend is written with NodeJS with TypeScript, and is created as AWS Lambdas.
      This is the third iteration of the back-end. Originally it was in PHP, then NodeJS with ExpressJS, and now it's moved to AWS Lambda.
    </p>

    <p>
      For the database that stores all the item price data, recipes, items and pets it uses MariaDB.
    </p>

    <p>
      Instead of querying the database for static data, this is stored on AWS s3 as compressed JSON files.
      This reduces the hosting costs, as the app don't have to waste compute resources when it does not need to.
      I do for now, store all auctions for the past 30 days on S3, and keep price history over the past 14 days in the database.
